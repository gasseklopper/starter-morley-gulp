							From photoshop 7.0, adobe xd, adobe experience
							manager(AEM), creative cloud 2020, writing
							javascript, speaking with api's, and develop large
							scale web/app projects. all these activitys are used
							with a focus being effective and efficient, working
							with UI from given tools is a 24/7 challenge for me
							to get more effective.
						</p>
						<p>
							The last 3 years i worked as a UX/designer at
							Comwrap in Frankfurt. Building Prototypes,
							concepting websites, developing atomic design
							frontend components for enterprise CMS systems.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also my 15 Years Experience as a photographer for
							high end commercials, teached me how important it is
							that something visual have to tell you large but
							clear story in seconds. i can apply these to User
							interfaces
